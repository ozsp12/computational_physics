# Computational Physics (mathematical methods for AI)

In a Physics course, we learn various mathematical methods that help us understand the physical world and fit naturally within the realm of data science. Many techniques, such as numerical analysis, differential equations, and probability theory, are fundamental in computational physics and apply to machine learning, optimization, and statistical modeling.  This repository contains a collection of computational physics scripts showcasing implementations of key numerical methods used in physics simulations, modeling, and data analysis. The goal is to highlight the strong connection between computational physics and data science, demonstrating how physics-inspired approaches can be applied to modern data-driven problems.  

# What's Inside  
Many of these methods, originally developed to study physical systems, are now widely used in computational fields such as machine learning, scientific computing, and data-driven modeling. By bridging computational physics with modern data science, this repository is a practical reference for physicists and data scientists looking to explore their intersection.
